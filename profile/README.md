# Oreum Industries: Technical Resources

[Oreum Industries](https://oreum.io) is a data science consultancy from 
[Jonathan Sedar](https://github.com/jonsedar) in collaboration with a worldwide
network of expert developers and leaders. We focus on the insurance industry, 
helping underwriters, insurtechs and corporates to learn from data. We operate 
remotely & globally, with a client base spanning USA, UK, Europe and the Middle 
East.

Our technical bread and butter is advanced Bayesian statistical modeling, 
to create an edge in pricing & reserving throughout general & life insurance.
This is essential to quantify uncertainty and support underwriter-led real-world 
decision-making in low data environments.

As opportunity allows, we host a handful of technical resources here. In each 
case at least a Technical Overview is public, and in some cases we've made the 
code available to read, or even fully open-source. Naturally we can't open 
everything, so where code is closed, please contact 
[info@oreum.io](mailto:info@oreum.io) for commercial interest - we'd be more 
than happy to discuss in detail.

## Technical References

These are the result of a concise exploration and implementation of specific 
tools & techniques relevant to our modeling work. They often contain novel
model architectures, describe theory and practice at a deep level, and use 
Bayesian inference and a Bayesian workflow, specifically using the 
`pymc` & `arviz` ecosystem.

  Copula Regression Modeling. This provides an extremely valuable method to 
  properly estimate Expected Loss Costs when Claims Frequency & Severity are 
  correlated in low data environments. _Public Intro Slides, Commercial License_.

+ [**Oreum Survival**](https://github.com/oreum-industries/oreum_survival) 
  Survival Regression Modeling. This provides an extremely valuable suite of 
  model architectures to estimate time-to-event via right-censored Accelerated 
  Failure Time (AFT) and semi-parametric (CoxPH) models.

## Case Studies

These are the result of a deep-dive investigation into a particular dataset, 
either to learn about that data or to fully demonstrate a suite of methods to
tackle a new challenge.

+ [**Oreum Case Study: Lung**](https://oreum-industries.github.io/oreum_cs_lung/#/)
  Survival regression of a lung cancer mortality study with conventional 
  full-period observations. Uses a novel Accelerated Failure Time architecture 
  that handles right-censoring, missing data, ordinal covariates and a linear 
  regression submodel. _Public Overview Slides, Commercial License_.

+ [**Oreum Case Study: ONS**](https://oreum-industries.github.io/oreum_cs_ons/#/)
  Survival regression of a multi-year England & Wales ONS aggregated deaths-only 
  dataset. This is a very compromised dataset but interesting to tackle, and 
  requires a highly novel modified AFT architecture to allow for right-truncation 
  (not right-censoring). _Public Overview Slides, Commercial License_.
  
+ [**Oreum Wholelife Simulator**](https://github.com/oreum-industries/oreum_mre_wholelife)
   Simulate the cash value of WholeLife Insurance Policies using a parameterised
   survival curve including financial activities (investments, drawdowns).
